Description: BAnOCC is a package designed for compositional data, where
        each sample sums to one. It infers the approximate covariance
        of the unconstrained data using a Bayesian model coded with
        `rstan`. It provides as output the `stanfit` object as well as
        posterior median and credible interval estimates for each
        correlation element.
