	Abstract = {Summary: When designing a case-control study to investigate differences in microbial composition, it is fundamental to assess the sample sizes needed to detect an hypothesized difference with sufficient statistical power. Our application includes power calculation for (i) a recoded version of the two-sample generalized Wald test of the `HMP' R-package for comparing community composition, and (ii) the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test for comparing operational taxonomic unit-specific abundances between two samples (optional). The simulation-based power calculations make use of the Dirichlet-Multinomial model to describe and generate abundances. The web interface allows for easy specification of sample and effect sizes. As an illustration of our application, we compared the statistical power of the two tests, with and without stratification of samples. We observed that statistical power increases considerably when stratification is employed, meaning that less samples are needed to detect the same effect size with the same power.Availability and implementation: The web interface is written in R code using Shiny (RStudio Inc., 2016) and it is available at https://fedematt.shinyapps.io/shinyMB. The R code for the recoded generalized Wald test can be found at https://github.com/mafed/msWaldHMP.Contact: Federico.Mattiello@UGent.be},

@article{Blanton2016,
	Abstract = {Poor nutrition during the early years of life can have severe consequences for subsequent skeletal, immunological, and intellectual development. Blanton et al. review the evidence showing that undernutrition is not caused by food insecurity alone. Other factors range from the length of the breastfeeding period and the availability of milk oligosaccharides, enteropathogen exposure, and enteric dysfunction marked by villus atrophy and loss of gut barrier function. Unfortunately, nutritional restoration with or without antibiotic treatment may not be effective in the longer term. Differences in the succession of microbial establishment and maturity can explain much of family discordances in nutritional status. The evidence indicates that microbiota-directed therapeutics could be a promising route to nutritional restoration in these children.Science, this issue p. 1533BACKGROUNDChildhood undernutrition is a global health challenge. Undernutrition in early life is associated with a number of adverse outcomes, including persistent stunting, immune dysfunction, and neurocognitive deficits. Current approaches to treatment have only modest effects in correcting these long-term sequelae, suggesting that certain features of host biology are not being adequately repaired. This has led to the hypothesis that healthy growth is dependent, in part, on normal postnatal development of the gut microbiota and that perturbations in its development are causally related to undernutrition. Testing this hypothesis illustrates a number of the challenges that human microbial ecology research faces: (i) defining {\textquotedblleft}normal,{\textquotedblright} both in terms of community structure and expressed functions; (ii) determining whether normal in one population generalizes to other populations; (iii) ascertaining whether deviations from normal correlate with disease and are a cause rather than an effect of pathology; (iv) determining whether abnormal microbial community configurations can be repaired in a sustained fashion, and what route and time course are optimal for such repair; (v) deciphering the short- and long-term effects and safety of repair; and (vi) proactively addressing the ethical, regulatory, and other societal implications of microbiota-directed food and/or microbial interventions designed to deliberately manipulate this facet of postnatal human development.ADVANCESCulture-independent studies of the gut microbiota of members of birth cohorts with healthy growth phenotypes have identified a program of community assembly ({\textquotedblleft}maturation{\textquotedblright}) defined by the changing representation of a group of age-discriminatory bacterial taxa. Features of this program are shared across individuals living in several low-income countries. Applying metrics for defining deviations from this program (microbiota-for-age Z score) has disclosed that children with severe acute malnutrition have gut microbial communities that appear younger than would be expected on the basis of their chronological age. The resulting microbiota {\textquotedblleft}immaturity{\textquotedblright} is not repaired by current therapeutic food interventions. Compared with healthy children, microbiota from undernourished children transmit impaired growth phenotypes to recipient gnotobiotic mice fed diets representative of those of the human donors; moreover, some of the transplanted age-discriminatory strains are growth-discriminatory. These findings provide early preclinical proof-of-concept that gut microbiota immaturity is causally related to a number of the manifestations of childhood undernutrition.OUTLOOKGnotobiotic animal models can be used to test a number of concepts. Gut microbiota immaturity, increased enteropathogen burden, and gut barrier dysfunction are interrelated factors that affect disease risk and pathogenesis. Microbiota development is linked to maturation of the gut mucosal immune system, metabolic function in multiple host tissues, plus musculoskeletal and brain development. Age- and growth-discriminatory bacterial strains identified in the normally developing microbiota represent therapeutic targets in children with undernutrition. The representation of these strains provides a way not only for defining the efficacy of these therapeutic interventions but also for assessing the effects of various parameters postulated to contribute to disease risk and pathogenesis (such as maternal health status, breast milk composition, history and quality of complementary feeding, poor sanitation and enteropathogen burden, and antibiotic exposures). Microbiota-directed strategies for treating and ultimately preventing childhood undernutrition raise intriguing questions about the mechanisms that define human development. They also highlight the need to add a microbial dimension to our conceptualization of human biological immaturity and its associated adaptations and compensations, and to consider whether interventions that promote healthy microbiota development can spawn a form of preventative medicine that has lifelong benefits.The concept that impaired postnatal gut microbiota development (maturation) is causally related to childhood undernutrition.The representation of age-discriminatory bacterial taxa defines a program of normal gut microbiota development. Disrupting the coordinated functional codevelopment of microbiota and host affects multiple biological regulatory systems through largely unknown mechanisms. Developing effective strategies for sustained repair of microbiota immaturity though food or microbial interventions requires preclinical studies of these mechanisms and modeling of the effects of different rates and routes of repair.Childhood undernutrition is a major global health challenge. Although current therapeutic approaches have reduced mortality in individuals with severe disease, they have had limited efficacy in ameliorating long-term sequelae, notably stunting, immune dysfunction, and neurocognitive deficits. Recent work is providing insights about the role of impaired development of the human gut microbiota in disease pathogenesis, leading to new concepts for treatment and prevention. These findings raise intriguing basic questions about the mechanisms that direct normal gut microbial community assembly and functional maturation. Designing and implementing new microbiota-directed therapeutics for undernutrition highlights the need to simultaneously consider a variety of features of human biology as well as broader societal issues.},

@article{Roverato2000,
	Abstract = {The canonical parameter of a covariance selection model is the inverse covariance matrix [sum ]-1 whose zero pattern gives the conditional independence structure characterising the model. In this paper we consider the upper triangular matrix Φ obtained by the Cholesky decomposition [sum ]-1 = ΦTΦ. This provides an interesting alternative parameterisation of decomposable models since its upper triangle has the same zero structure as [sum ]-1 and its elements have an interpretation as parameters of certain conditional distributions. For a distribution for [sum ], the strong hyper-Markov property is shown to be characterised by the mutual independence of the rows of Φ. This is further used to generalise to the hyper inverse Wishart distribution some well-known properties of the inverse Wishart distribution. In particular we show that a hyper inverse Wishart matrix can be decomposed into independent normal and chi-squared random variables, and we describe a family of transformations under which the family of hyper inverse Wishart distributions is closed.},

@article{DawidAndLauritzen1993,
	Abstract = {This paper introduces and investigates the notion of a hyper Markov law, which is a probability distribution over the set of probability measures on a multivariate space that (i) is concentrated on the set of Markov probabilities over some decomposable graph, and (ii) satisfies certain conditional independence restrictions related to that graph. A stronger version of this hyper Markov property is also studied. Our analysis starts by reconsidering the properties of Markov probabilities, using an abstract approach which thereafter proves equally applicable to the hyper Markov case. Next, it is shown constructively that hyper Markov laws exist, that they appear as sampling distributions of maximum likelihood estimators in decomposable graphical models, and also that they form natural conjugate prior distributions for a Bayesian analysis of these models. As examples we construct a range of specific hyper Markov laws, including the hyper multinomial, hyper Dirichlet and the hyper Wishart and inverse Wishart laws. These laws occur naturally in connection with the analysis of decomposable log-linear and covariance selection models.},

We describe the estimator's advantages over existing approaches, including its robustness, adaptivity to different sparsity patterns and analytical tractability. We prove two theorems: one that characterizes the horseshoe estimator's tail robustness and the other that demonstrates a super-efficient rate of convergence to the correct estimate of the sampling density in sparse situations. Finally, using both real and simulated data, we show that the horseshoe estimator corresponds quite closely to the answers obtained by Bayesian model averaging under a point-mass mixture prior.},

@article{WagnerEtAl2016,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Developing targeted therapeutics and identifying biomarkers relies on large amounts of research participant data. Beyond human DNA, scientists now investigate the DNA of micro-organisms inhabiting the human body. Recent work shows that an individual's collection of microbial DNA consistently identifies that person and could be used to link a real-world identity to a sensitive attribute in a research dataset. Unfortunately, the current suite of DNA-specific privacy-preserving analysis tools does not meet the requirements for microbiome sequencing studies.Results: To address privacy concerns around microbiome sequencing, we implement metagenomic analyses using secure computation. Our implementation allows comparative analysis over combined data without revealing the feature counts for any individual sample. We focus on three analyses and perform an evaluation on datasets currently used by the microbiome research community. We use our implementation to simulate sharing data between four policy-domains. Additionally, we describe an application of our implementation for patients to combine data that allows drug developers to query against and compensate patients for the analysis.Availability and implementation: The software is freely available for download at: http://cbcb.umd.edu/∼hcorrada/projects/secureseq.htmlSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.Contact: hcorrada@umiacs.umd.edu},

@article{FuhrmanAndSteele2008,
	Annote = {ABSTRACT: Major challenges in marine microbial ecology include determining patterns of community structure and structure--function relationships. Progress has occurred by a combination of molecular and classical techniques. An example for this is work on the marine Crenarchaeota, extremely abundant organisms that we now think play important roles both as autotrophic ammonium oxidizers and as heterotrophs. Another involves the recently discovered Proteorhodopsins, pigments that are potentially important in solar energy capture, yet often do not seem to confer a clear growth benefit to organisms that possess them. Proteorhodopsins occur in numerous phylogenetic groups and may have multiple roles, complicating the linking of these proteins to a well-defined function. Community fingerprinting is a powerful tool for examining community structure and for examining spatial and temporal distribution patterns. Using fingerprinting, we found that ocean communities tend to occur in patches with horizontal dimensions of several km, while samples 10s of km or more apart can be quite different. Temporal analyses such as the San Pedro Ocean Time Series (SPOT) show that near-surface communities are somewhat similar from month to month, then change significantly over several months, and finally return to a similar community annually. Near-surface communities can also be predicted from environmental parameters like temperature, salinity, nutrients, and chlorophyll. Time series data show co-occurrence of organisms (resembling a succession of communities) under particular conditions, or conversely can show which organisms are significantly negatively correlated, indicative perhaps of competition, resource partitioning, or allelopathy. These relationships are visualized here as mathematical interaction networks to map out the `niche space'of microbial taxa and their correlations, displaying complex ecological interactions. Observations indicate that ecological relatedness does not necessarily closely follow phylogenetic relatedness. },

	Abstract = {The study of species co-occurrences has been central in community ecology since the foundation of the discipline. Co-occurrence data are, nevertheless, a neglected source of information to model species distributions and biogeographers are still debating about the impact of biotic interactions on species distributions across geographical scales. We argue that a theory of species co-occurrence in ecological networks is needed to better inform interpretation of co-occurrence data, to formulate hypotheses for different community assembly mechanisms, and to extend the analysis of species distributions currently focused on the relationship between occurrences and abiotic factors. The main objective of this paper is to provide the first building blocks of a general theory for species co-occurrences. We formalize the problem with definitions of the different probabilities that are studied in the context of co-occurrence analyses. We analyze three species interactions modules and conduct multi-species simulations in order to document five principles influencing the associations between species within an ecological network: (i) direct interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (ii) indirect interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (iii) pairwise co-occurrence rarely are symmetric, (iv) the strength of an association decreases with the length of the shortest path between two species, and (v) the strength of an association decreases with the number of interactions a species is experiencing. Our analyses reveal the difficulty of the interpretation of species interactions from co-occurrence data. We discuss whether the inference of the structure of interaction networks is feasible from co-occurrence data. We also argue that species distributions models could benefit from incorporating conditional probabilities of interactions within the models as an attempt to take into account the contribution of biotic interactions to shaping individual distributions of species.},

@article{StoneAndRoberts1990,
	Abstract = {There has been an ongoing controversy over how to decide whether the distribution of species is ``random'' --- i.e., whether it is not greatly different from what it would be if species did not interact. We recently showed (Roberts and Stone (1990)) that in the case of the Vanuatu (formerly New Hebrides) avifauna, the number of islands shared by species pairs was incompatible with a ``random'' null hypothesis. However, it was difficult to determine the causes or direction of the community's exceptionality. In this paper, the latter problem is examined further. We use Diamond's (1975) notion of checkerboard distributions (originally developed as an indicator of competition) and construct a C-score statistic which quantifies ``checkerboardedness''. This statistic is based on the way two species might colonise a pair of islands; whenever each species colonises a different island this adds 1 to the C-score. Following Connor and Simberloff (1979) we generate a ``control group'' of random colonisation patterns (matrices), and use the C-score to determine their checkerboard characteristics. As an alternative mode of enquiry, we make slight alterations to the observed data, repeating this process many times so as to obtain another ``control group''. In both cases, when we compare the observed data for the Vanuatu avifauna and the Antillean bat communities with that given by their respective ``control group'', we find that these communities have significantly large checkerboard distributions, making implausible the hypothesis that their species distributions are a product of random colonisation.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Characterizing the diversity of microbial communities and understanding the environmental factors that influence community diversity are central tenets of microbial ecology. The development and application of cultivation independent molecular tools has allowed for rapid surveying of microbial community composition at unprecedented resolutions and frequencies. There is a growing need to discern robust patterns and relationships within these datasets which provide insight into microbial ecology. Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) analysis is commonly used for identifying the linear relationship between two species, or species and environmental factors. However, this approach may not be able to capture more complex interactions which occur in situ; thus, alternative analyses were explored.Results: In this paper we introduced local similarity analysis (LSA), which is a technique that can identify more complex dependence associations among species as well as associations between species and environmental factors without requiring significant data reduction. To illustrate its capability of identifying relationships that may not otherwise be identified by PCC, we first applied LSA to simulated data. We then applied LSA to a marine microbial observatory dataset and identified unique, significant associations that were not detected by PCC analysis. LSA results, combined with results from PCC analysis were used to construct a theoretical ecological network which allows for easy visualization of the most significant associations. Biological implications of the significant associations detected by LSA were discussed. We also identified additional applications where LSA would be beneficial.Availability: The algorithms are implemented in Splus/R and they are available upon request from the corresponding author.Contact:fsun@usc.edu},

This approach is illustrated using data from the pelagic community of a small lake: Tuesday Lake, Michigan, United States. Body mass varies almost 12 orders of magnitude. Numerical abundance varies almost 10 orders of magnitude. Biomass abundance (average body mass times numerical abundance) varies only 5 orders of magnitude. A new food web graph, which plots species and trophic links in the plane spanned by body mass and numerical abundance, illustrates the nearly inverse relationship between body mass and numerical abundance, as well as the pattern of energy flow in the community. Species with small average body mass occur low in the food web of Tuesday Lake and are numerically abundant. Larger-bodied species occur higher in the food web and are numerically rarer. Average body size explains more of the variation in numerical abundance than does trophic height. The trivariate description of an ecological community by using the food web, average body sizes, and numerical abundance includes many well studied bivariate and univariate relationships based on subsets of these three variables. We are not aware of any single community for which all of these relationships have been analyzed simultaneously. Our approach demonstrates the connectedness of ecological patterns traditionally treated as independent. Moreover, knowing the food web gives new insight into the disputed form of the allometric relationship between body mass and abundance.},

* Three types of food webs (from Cohen, JE Food Webs and Niche Space):
  * Source pick an organism and look at its predators and its predators' predators, etc.
  * Sink pick and organism and look at its prey and its prey's prey, etc.
  * Community pick a bunch of organisms irrespective of their predator-prey relationships and figure out the relationships between them

* Some of the oldest published food webs:
  * Pierce et al 1912
  * Shelford 1913 ('often credited as the first published web')

* Reference with a compilation of ~100 food webs: Cohen, JE, Briand, F and Newman, CM. Community food webs: Data and theory (Springer-Veriag., New York, 1990)

* Some (then-)common statistics:
  * Cycles (j -> i -> j or i -> j -> k -> i)
  * Connectance: number of actual trophic interactions divided by the number of possible interactions (several variants exist with different definitions of 'possible interactions')
  * "Compartments exist when linkages are few or weak between groups and [{\ldots}] common or strong within those groups"

* Published webs are often simplified by:
   * Aggregation or selection
   * Linkages based on observation or selected for 'artistical convenience'

* Web structure varies across time and space; whether these are aggregated or kept separate affects the results (cumulative vs. time-specific)
  * Rare species that are sampled only occasionally, for example
* Boundaries of where the web ends are often arbitrary

* Two-dimensional habitats (grasslands or intertidal) vs. three-dimensional (forests, water columns of lakes or oceans)

* Detritivores = species that feed on detritus (macroscopic decomposers like earthworms, per wikipedia)

* Lotka-Volterra equations to model food webs help determine which might be stable and which unstable

* Cascade model vs. dynamic model (Lotka-Volterra eqns)

	Abstract = {Motivation: The human microbiome plays a key role in health and disease. Thanks to comparative metatranscriptomics, the cellular functions that are deregulated by the microbiome in disease can now be computationally explored. Unlike gene-centric approaches, pathway-based methods provide a systemic view of such functions; however, they typically consider each pathway in isolation and in its entirety. They can therefore overlook the key differences that (i) span multiple pathways, (ii) contain bidirectionally deregulated components, (iii) are confined to a pathway region. To capture these properties, computational methods that reach beyond the scope of predefined pathways are needed.Results: By integrating an existing module discovery algorithm into comparative metatranscriptomic analysis, we developed metaModules, a novel computational framework for automated identification of the key functional differences between health- and disease-associated communities. Using this framework, we recovered significantly deregulated subnetworks that were indeed recognized to be involved in two well-studied, microbiome-mediated oral diseases, such as butanoate production in periodontal disease and metabolism of sugar alcohols in dental caries. More importantly, our results indicate that our method can be used for hypothesis generation based on automated discovery of novel, disease-related functional subnetworks, which would otherwise require extensive and laborious manual assessment.Availability and implementation: metaModules is available at https://bitbucket.org/alimay/metamodules/Contact: a.may@vu.nl or s.abeln@vu.nlSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	Abstract = {Often the goal of model selection is to choose a model for future prediction, and it is natural to measure the accuracy of a future prediction by squared error loss. Under the Bayesian approach, it is commonly perceived that the optimal predictive model is the model with highest posterior probability, but this is not necessarily the case. In this paper we show that, for selection among normal linear models, the optimal predictive model is often the median probability model, which is defined as the model consisting of those variables which have overall posterior probability greater than or equal to 1/2 of being in a model. The median probability model often differs from the highest probability model.},

	Abstract = {Summary: During the past years we have witnessed the rapid development of new metagenome assembly methods. Although there are many benchmark utilities designed for single-genome assemblies, there is no well-recognized evaluation and comparison tool for metagenomic-specific analogues. In this article, we present MetaQUAST, a modification of QUAST, the state-of-the-art tool for genome assembly evaluation based on alignment of contigs to a reference. MetaQUAST addresses such metagenome datasets features as (i) unknown species content by detecting and downloading reference sequences, (ii) huge diversity by giving comprehensive reports for multiple genomes and (iii) presence of highly relative species by detecting chimeric contigs. We demonstrate MetaQUAST performance by comparing several leading assemblers on one simulated and two real datasets.Availability and implementation: http://bioinf.spbau.ru/metaquast.Contact: aleksey.gurevich@spbu.ruSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{VervierEtAl2016,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Metagenomics characterizes the taxonomic diversity of microbial communities by sequencing DNA directly from an environmental sample. One of the main challenges in metagenomics data analysis is the binning step, where each sequenced read is assigned to a taxonomic clade. Because of the large volume of metagenomics datasets, binning methods need fast and accurate algorithms that can operate with reasonable computing requirements. While standard alignment-based methods provide state-of-the-art performance, compositional approaches that assign a taxonomic class to a DNA read based on the k-mers it contains have the potential to provide faster solutions.Results: We propose a new rank-flexible machine learning-based compositional approach for taxonomic assignment of metagenomics reads and show that it benefits from increasing the number of fragments sampled from reference genome to tune its parameters, up to a coverage of about 10, and from increasing the k-mer size to about 12. Tuning the method involves training machine learning models on about 108 samples in 107 dimensions, which is out of reach of standard softwares but can be done efficiently with modern implementations for large-scale machine learning. The resulting method is competitive in terms of accuracy with well-established alignment and composition-based tools for problems involving a small to moderate number of candidate species and for reasonable amounts of sequencing errors. We show, however, that machine learning-based compositional approaches are still limited in their ability to deal with problems involving a greater number of species and more sensitive to sequencing errors. We finally show that the new method outperforms the state-of-the-art in its ability to classify reads from species of lineage absent from the reference database and confirm that compositional approaches achieve faster prediction times, with a gain of 2--17 times with respect to the BWA-MEM short read mapper, depending on the number of candidate species and the level of sequencing noise.Availability and implementation: Data and codes are available at http://cbio.ensmp.fr/largescalemetagenomics.Contact: pierre.mahe@biomerieux.comSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Metagenomics research has accelerated the studies of microbial organisms, providing insights into the composition and potential functionality of various microbial communities. Metatranscriptomics (studies of the transcripts from a mixture of microbial species) and other meta-omics approaches hold even greater promise for providing additional insights into functional and regulatory characteristics of the microbial communities. Current metatranscriptomics projects are often carried out without matched metagenomic datasets (of the same microbial communities). For the projects that produce both metatranscriptomic and metagenomic datasets, their analyses are often not integrated. Metagenome assemblies are far from perfect, partially explaining why metagenome assemblies are not used for the analysis of metatranscriptomic datasets.Results: Here, we report a reads mapping algorithm for mapping of short reads onto a de Bruijn graph of assemblies. A hash table of junction k-mers (k-mers spanning branching structures in the de Bruijn graph) is used to facilitate fast mapping of reads to the graph. We developed an application of this mapping algorithm: a reference-based approach to metatranscriptome assembly using graphs of metagenome assembly as the reference. Our results show that this new approach (called TAG) helps to assemble substantially more transcripts that otherwise would have been missed or truncated because of the fragmented nature of the reference metagenome.Availability and implementation: TAG was implemented in C++ and has been tested extensively on the Linux platform.

The mixed culture consists of four bacterial strains (a cellulose-degrading anaerobe [strain S], a saccharide-utilizing anaerobe [strain F], a peptide- and acetate-utilizing aerobe [strain 3] and a peptide-, glucose-, and ethanol-utilizing aerobe [strain 5]). Interspecies interactions were examined by analyzing the effects of culture filtrates on the growth of the other strains and by comprehensively analyzing population dynamics in the mixed-culture systems with all possible combinations of the four bacterial strains. The persistence of strain S depends on the effects of strain 5. However, strain 5 is a disadvantaged strain because strain 3 has bacteriocidal activity on strain 5. The extinction of strain 5 is indirectly prevented by strain F that suppresses the growth of strain 3. Although strain F directly has suppressive effects on the growth of strain S, strain F is essential for the persistence of strain S, considering the indirect effects (maintaining strain 5, which is essential for the survival of strain S, by inhibiting strain 3). These indirect relationships form a bacterial network in which all the relationships including suppressive effects were well balanced to maintain the structural stability. In addition to direct metabolite interactions, such kind of indirect relationships could have a great impact on microbial community structure in the natural environment.},

	Annote = {Cooperation fundamentally contributes to the success of life on earth, but its persistence in diverse communities remains a riddle, as selfish phenotypes rapidly evolve and may spread until disrupting cooperation. Here we investigate how evolutionary history affects the emergence and spread of defectors in multispecies communities. We set up bacterial communities of varying diversity and phylogenetic relatedness and measure investment into cooperation (proteolytic activity) and their vulnerability to invasion by defectors. We show that evolutionary relationships predict the stability of cooperation: phylogenetically diverse communities are rapidly invaded by spontaneous signal-blind mutants (ignoring signals regulating cooperation), while cooperation is stable in closely related ones. Maintenance of cooperation is controlled by antagonism against defectors: cooperators inhibit phylogenetically related defectors, but not distant ones. This kin-dependent inhibition links phylogenetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics and thus provides a robust mechanistic predictor for the persistence of cooperation in natural communities.},

	Abstract = {Classical definitions of syntrophy focus on a process, performed through metabolic interaction between dependent microbial partners, such as the degradation of complex organic compounds under anoxic conditions. However, examples from past and current scientific discoveries suggest that a new, simple but wider definition is necessary to cover all aspects of microbial syntrophy. We suggest the term {\textquoteleft}obligately mutualistic metabolism{\textquoteright}, which still focuses on microbial metabolic cooperation but also includes an ecological aspect: the benefit for both partners. By the combined metabolic activity of microorganisms, endergonic reactions can become exergonic through the efficient removal of products and therefore enable a microbial community to survive with minimal energy resources. Here, we explain the principles of classical and non-classical syntrophy and illustrate the concepts with various examples. We present biochemical fundamentals that allow microorganism to survive under a range of environmental conditions and to drive important biogeochemical processes. Novel technologies have contributed to the understanding of syntrophic relationships in cultured and uncultured systems. Recent research highlights that obligately mutualistic metabolism is not limited to certain metabolic pathways nor to certain environments or microorganisms. This beneficial microbial interaction is not restricted to the transfer of reducing agents such as hydrogen or formate, but can also involve the exchange of organic, sulfurous- and nitrogenous compounds or the removal of toxic compounds.},

	Abstract = {Microbial communities populate most environments on earth and play a critical role in ecology and human health. Their composition is thought to be largely shaped by interspecies competition for the available resources, but cooperative interactions, such as metabolite exchanges, have also been implicated in community assembly. The prevalence of metabolic interactions in microbial communities, however, has remained largely unknown. Here, we systematically survey, by using a genome-scale metabolic modeling approach, the extent of resource competition and metabolic exchanges in over 800 communities. We find that, despite marked resource competition at the level of whole assemblies, microbial communities harbor metabolically interdependent groups that recur across diverse habitats. By enumerating flux-balanced metabolic exchanges in these co-occurring subcommunities we also predict the likely exchanged metabolites, such as amino acids and sugars, that can promote group survival under nutritionally challenging conditions. Our results highlight metabolic dependencies as a major driver of species co-occurrence and hint at cooperative groups as recurring modules of microbial community architecture.},

To address these issues, we present the GUide to STatistical Analysis in Microbial Ecology (GUSTA ME): a dynamic, web-based resource providing accessible descriptions of numerous multivariate techniques relevant to microbial ecologists. A combination of interactive elements allows users to discover and navigate between methods relevant to their needs and examine how they have been used by others in the field.

	Abstract = {Interpretive analysis of metagenomic data depends on an understanding of the underlying associations among microbes from metagenomic samples.Although several statistical tools have been developed for metagenomic association studies, they suffer from compositional bias or fail to take into account environmental factors that directly affect the composition of a given microbial community. In this paper, we propose metagenomic Lognormal-Dirichlet-Multinomial (mLDM), a hierarchical Bayesian model with sparsity constraints to bypass compositional bias and discover new associations among microbes and between microbes and environmental factors. The mLDM model can 1) infer both conditionally dependent associations among microbes and direct associations between microbes and environmental factors; 2) consider both compositional bias and variance of metagenomic data; and 3) estimate absolute abundance for microbes. Thus, conditionally dependent association can capture direct relationship underlying microbial pairs and remove the indirect connections induced from other common factors. Empirical studies show the effectiveness of the mLDM model, using both synthetic data and the TARA Oceans eukaryotic data by comparing it with several state-of-the-art methodologies. Finally, mLDM is applied to western English Channel data and finds some interesting associations.},

	Abstract = {In utero, babies are relatively microbe-free but are quickly colonized at birth. These early microbial residents help to shape our immune systems. Gomez de Ag{\"u}ero et al. wondered whether the maternal microbiome also affects the of springs{\textquoteright} immune system during gestation. To do this, they transiently colonized otherwise microbe-free pregnant mice. Compared to those born to microbe-free moms, pups born to colonized moms had increased numbers of certain innate immune cells and different patterns of gene expression in their guts.Science, this issue p. 1296Postnatal colonization of the body with microbes is assumed to be the main stimulus to postnatal immune development. By transiently colonizing pregnant female mice, we show that the maternal microbiota shapes the immune system of the offspring. Gestational colonization increases intestinal group 3 innate lymphoid cells and F4/80+CD11c+ mononuclear cells in the pups. Maternal colonization reprograms intestinal transcriptional profiles of the offspring, including increased expression of genes encoding epithelial antibacterial peptides and metabolism of microbial molecules. Some of these effects are dependent on maternal antibodies that potentially retain microbial molecules and transmit them to the offspring during pregnancy and in milk. Pups born to mothers transiently colonized in pregnancy are better able to avoid inflammatory responses to microbial molecules and penetration of intestinal microbes.},

	Abstract = {Gut microbiota is an assortment of microorganisms inhabiting the length and width of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. The composition of this microbial community is host specific, evolving throughout an individual{\textquoteright}s lifetime and susceptible to both exogenous and endogenous modifications. Recent renewed interest in the structure and function of this {\textquotedblleft}organ{\textquotedblright} has illuminated its central position in health and disease. The microbiota is intimately involved in numerous aspects of normal host physiology, from nutritional status to behavior and stress response. Additionally, they can be a central or a contributing cause of many diseases, affecting both near and far organ systems. The overall balance in the composition of the gut microbial community, as well as the presence or absence of key species capable of effecting specific responses, is important in ensuring homeostasis or lack thereof at the intestinal mucosa and beyond. The mechanisms through which microbiota exerts its beneficial or detrimental influences remain largely undefined, but include elaboration of signaling molecules and recognition of bacterial epitopes by both intestinal epithelial and mucosal immune cells. The advances in modeling and analysis of gut microbiota will further our knowledge of their role in health and disease, allowing customization of existing and future therapeutic and prophylactic modalities.},

The decreasing cost and increasing speed of DNA sequencing technology has recently provided scientists with affordable and timely access to the genes and genomes of microbiomes that inhabit our planet and even our own bodies. In these investigations many microbiome samples are sequenced at the same time on the same DNA sequencing machine, but often result in total numbers of sequences per sample that are vastly different. The common procedure for addressing this difference in sequencing effort across samples ? different <italic>library sizes</italic> ? is to either (1) base analyses on the proportional abundance of each species in a library, or (2) <italic>rarefy</italic>, throw away sequences from the larger libraries so that all have the same, smallest size. We show that both of these <italic>normalization methods</italic> can work when comparing obviously-different whole microbiomes, but that neither method works well when comparing the relative proportions of each bacterial species across microbiome samples. We show that alternative methods based on a statistical <italic>mixture model</italic> perform much better and can be easily adapted from a separate biological sub-discipline, called RNA-Seq analysis.</p>},

	Abstract = {Resampling methods are frequently used in practice to adjust critical values of nonparametric tests. In the present paper a comprehensive and unified approach for the conditional and unconditional analysis of linear resampling statistics is presented. Under fairly mild assumptions we prove tightness and an asymptotic series representation for their weak accumulation points. From this series it becomes clear which part of the resampling statistic is responsible for asymptotic normality. The results leads to a discussion of the asymptotic correctness of resampling methods as well as their applications in testing hypotheses. They are conditionally correct iff a central limit theorem holds for the original test statistic. We prove unconditional correctness iff the central limit theorem holds or when symmetric random variables are resampled by a scheme of asymptotically random signs. Special cases are the m(n) out of k(n) bootstrap, the weighted bootstrap, the wild bootstrap and all kinds of permutation statistics. The program is carried out for convergent partial sums of rowwise independent infinitesimal triangular arrays in detail. These results are used to compare power functions of conditional resampling tests and their unconditional counterparts. The proof uses the method of random scores for permutation type statistics.},

	Abstract = {<p>We introduce Dirichlet multinomial mixtures (DMM) for the probabilistic modelling of microbial metagenomics data. This data can be represented as a frequency matrix giving the number of times each taxa is observed in each sample. The samples have different size, and the matrix is sparse, as communities are diverse and skewed to rare taxa. Most methods used previously to classify or cluster samples have ignored these features. We describe each community by a vector of taxa probabilities. These vectors are generated from one of a finite number of Dirichlet mixture components each with different hyperparameters. Observed samples are generated through multinomial sampling. The mixture components cluster communities into distinct ?metacommunities?, and, hence, determine envirotypes or enterotypes, groups of communities with a similar composition. The model can also deduce the impact of a treatment and be used for classification. We wrote software for the fitting of DMM models using the ?evidence framework? (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://code.google.com/p/microbedmm/" xlink:type="simple">http://code.google.com/p/microbedmm/</ext-link>). This includes the Laplace approximation of the model evidence. We applied the DMM model to human gut microbe genera frequencies from Obese and Lean twins. From the model evidence four clusters fit this data best. Two clusters were dominated by Bacteroides and were homogenous; two had a more variable community composition. We could not find a significant impact of body mass on community structure. However, Obese twins were more likely to derive from the high variance clusters. We propose that obesity is not associated with a distinct microbiota but increases the chance that an individual derives from a disturbed enterotype. This is an example of the ?Anna Karenina principle (AKP)? applied to microbial communities: disturbed states having many more configurations than undisturbed. We verify this by showing that in a study of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) phenotypes, ileal Crohn's disease (ICD) is associated with a more variable community.</p>},

	Abstract = {Two guidelines for nonparametric bootstrap hypothesis testing are highlighted. The first recommends that resampling be done in a way that reflects the null hypothesis, even when the true hypothesis is distant from the null. The second guideline argues that bootstrap hypothesis tests should employ methods that are already recognized as having good features in the closely related problem of confidence interval construction. Violation of the first guideline can seriously reduce the power of a test. Sometimes this reduction is spectacular, since it is most serious when the null hypothesis is grossly in error. The second guideline is of some importance when the conclusion of a test is equivocal. It has no direct bearing on power, but improves the level accuracy of a test.},

@article{EvansAndSwartz1995,
	Abstract = {This paper is a survey of the major techniques and approaches available for the numerical approximation of integrals in statistics. We classify these into five broad categories; namely, asymptotic methods, importance sampling, adaptive importance sampling, multiple quadrature and Markov chain methods. Each method is discussed, giving an outline of the basic supporting theory and particular features of the technique. Conclusions are drawn concerning the relative merits of the methods based on the discussion and their application to three examples. The following broad recommendations are made. Asymptotic methods should only be considered in contexts where the integrand has a dominant peak with approximate ellipsoidal symmetry. Importance sampling (and preferably adaptive importance sampling) based on a multivariate Student should be used instead of asymptotics methods in such a context. Multiple quadrature and, in particular, subregion adaptive integration are the algorithms of choice for lower-dimensional integrals. Due to the difficulties in assessing convergence to stationarity and the error in estimates, Markov chain methods are recommended only when there is no adequate alternative. In certain very high dimensional problems, however, Markov chain methods are the only hope. The importance of the parameterization of the integral is noted for the success of all the methods, and several useful reparameterizations are presented.},

Both theory and examples are used to show how this is done. The first seven sections provide a heuristic overview of four bootstrap confidence interval procedures: $BC_a$, bootstrap-$t$, ABC and calibration. Sections 8 and 9 describe the theory behind these methods, and their close connection with the likelihood-based confidence interval theory developed by Barndorff-Nielsen, Cox and Reid and others.},

Our ssCCA formulation utilizes a phylogenetic structure-constrained penalty function to impose certain smoothness on the linear coefficients according to the phylogenetic relationships among the taxa. An efficient coordinate descent algorithm is developed for optimization. A human gut microbiome data set is used to illustrate this method. Both simulations and real data applications show that ssCCA performs better than the standard sparse CCA in identifying meaningful variables when there are structures in the data.},

A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

However, due to the unique properties of community composition data, standard data analysis tools are likely to produce statistical artifacts. For a typical experiment studying microbial ecosystems these artifacts can lead to erroneous conclusions about patterns of associations between microbial taxa. We developed a new procedure that seeks to infer ecological associations between microbial populations, by 1) taking advantage of the proportionality invariance of relative abundance data and 2) making assumptions about the underlying network structure when the number of taxa in the dataset is larger than the number of sampled communities. Additionally, we employed a novel tool to generate biologically plausible synthetic data and objectively benchmark current association inference tools. Finally, we tested our procedures on a large-scale 16S rRNA gene sequencing dataset sampled from the human gut.</p>},

It was shown to be a non-linear operation in the simplex that does not preserve distances under perturbation. The discussion motivated the introduction in the present paper of concepts such as group of parts, balance between groups, and sequential binary partition, which are intended to provide tools of compositional data analysis for dimension reduction. Key concepts underlying this development are the established tools of subcomposition, coordinates in an orthogonal basis of the simplex, balancing element and, in general, the Aitchison geometry in the simplex. Main new results are: a method to analyze grouped parts of a compositional vector through the adequate coordinates in an ad hoc orthonormal basis; and the study of balances of groups of parts (inter-group analysis) as an orthogonal projection similar to that used in standard subcompositional analysis (intra-group analysis). A simulated example compares results when testing equal centers of two populations using amalgamated parts and balances; it shows that, in certain circumstances, results from both analysis can disagree.},

It is shown that the considered correlation measures are invariant with respect to the choice of the binary partitions forming the balances.

	Abstract = {The death of a large animal represents a food bonanza for microorganisms. Metcalf et al. monitored microbial activity during the decomposition of mouse and human cadavers. Regardless of soil type, season, or species, the microbial succession during decomposition was a predictable measure of time since death. An overlying corpse leaches nutrients that allow soil- and insect-associated fungi and bacteria to grow. These microorganisms are metabolic specialists that convert proteins and lipids into foul-smelling compounds such as cadaverine, putrescine, and ammonia, whose signature may persist in the soil long after a corpse has been removed.Science, this issue p. 158Vertebrate corpse decomposition provides an important stage in nutrient cycling in most terrestrial habitats, yet microbially mediated processes are poorly understood. Here we combine deep microbial community characterization, community-level metabolic reconstruction, and soil biogeochemical assessment to understand the principles governing microbial community assembly during decomposition of mouse and human corpses on different soil substrates. We find a suite of bacterial and fungal groups that contribute to nitrogen cycling and a reproducible network of decomposers that emerge on predictable time scales. Our results show that this decomposer community is derived primarily from bulk soil, but key decomposers are ubiquitous in low abundance. Soil type was not a dominant factor driving community development, and the process of decomposition is sufficiently reproducible to offer new opportunities for forensic investigations.},

@article{TabebordbarEtAl2016,
	Abstract = {Much of the controversy surrounding the gene-editing technology called CRISPR/Cas9 centers on the ethics of germline editing of human embryos to correct disease-causing mutations. For certain disorders such as muscular dystrophy, it may be possible to achieve therapeutic benefit by editing the faulty gene in somatic cells. In proof-of-concept studies, Long et al., Nelson et al., and Tabebordbar et al. used adeno-associated virus-9 to deliver the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system to young mice with a mutation in the gene coding for dystrophin, a muscle protein deficient in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Gene editing partially restored dystrophin protein expression in skeletal and cardiac muscle and improved skeletal muscle function.Science, this issue p. 400, p. 403, p. 407Frame-disrupting mutations in the DMD gene, encoding dystrophin, compromise myofiber integrity and drive muscle deterioration in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Removing one or more exons from the mutated transcript can produce an in-frame mRNA and a truncated, but still functional, protein. In this study, we developed and tested a direct gene-editing approach to induce exon deletion and recover dystrophin expression in the mdx mouse model of DMD. Delivery by adeno-associated virus (AAV) of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)--Cas9 endonucleases coupled with paired guide RNAs flanking the mutated Dmd exon23 resulted in excision of intervening DNA and restored the Dmd reading frame in myofibers, cardiomyocytes, and muscle stem cells after local or systemic delivery. AAV-Dmd CRISPR treatment partially recovered muscle functional deficiencies and generated a pool of endogenously corrected myogenic precursors in mdx mouse muscle.},

@article{SchwarzerEtAl2016,
	Abstract = {Malnutrition in children is a persistent challenge that is not always remedied by improvements in nutrition. This is because a characteristic community of gut microbes seems to mediate some of the pathology. Human gut microbes can be transplanted effectively into germ-free mice to recapitulate their associated phenotypes. Using this model, Blanton et al. found that the microbiota of healthy children relieved the harmful effects on growth caused by the microbiota of malnourished children. In infant mammals, chronic undernutrition results in growth hormone resistance and stunting. In mice, Schwarzer et al. showed that strains of Lactobacillus plantarum in the gut microbiota sustained growth hormone activity via signaling pathways in the liver, thus overcoming growth hormone resistance. Together these studies reveal that specific beneficial microbes could potentially be exploited to resolve undernutrition syndromes.Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad3311, p. 854In most animal species, juvenile growth is marked by an exponential gain in body weight and size. Here we show that the microbiota of infant mice sustains both weight gain and longitudinal growth when mice are fed a standard laboratory mouse diet or a nutritionally depleted diet. We found that the intestinal microbiota interacts with the somatotropic hormone axis to drive systemic growth. Using monocolonized mouse models, we showed that selected lactobacilli promoted juvenile growth in a strain-dependent manner that recapitulated the microbiota's effect on growth and the somatotropic axis. These findings show that the host's microbiota supports juvenile growth. Moreover, we discovered that lactobacilli strains buffered the adverse effects of chronic undernutrition on the postnatal growth of germ-free mice.},

	Abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>Microbial metabolism affects biogeochemical cycles and human health. In most natural environments, multiple microbial species interact with each other, forming complex ecosystems whose properties are poorly understood. In an effort to understand inter-microbial interactions, and to explore new metabolic engineering avenues, researchers have started building artificial microbial ecosystems, e.g. pairs of genetically engineered strains that require each other for survival. Here we computationally explore the possibility of creating artificial microbial ecosystems without re-engineering the microbes themselves, but rather by manipulating the environment in which they grow. Specifically, using the framework of flux balance analysis, we predict environments in which either one or both microbes in a pair would not be able to grow without the other, inducing commensal (one-way) or mutualistic (two-way) interactions, respectively. Our algorithms can successfully recapitulate known inter-microbial interactions, and predict millions of new ones across any pair amongst different microbial species. Surprisingly, we find that it is always possible to identify conditions that induce mutualistic or commensal interactions between any two species. Hence, our method should help in mapping naturally occurring microbe-microbe interactions, and in engineering new ones through a novel, environment-driven branch of synthetic ecology.</p> },

	Url = {http://www.pnas.org/content/108/10/4152.abstract N2 - Microbes in nature frequently function as members of complex multitaxon communities, but the structural organization of these communities at the micrometer level is poorly understood because of limitations in labeling and imaging technology. We report here a combinatorial labeling strategy coupled with spectral image acquisition and analysis that greatly expands the number of fluorescent signatures distinguishable in a single image. As an imaging proof of principle, we first demonstrated visualization of Escherichia coli labeled by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with 28 different binary combinations of eight fluorophores. As a biological proof of principle, we then applied this Combinatorial Labeling and Spectral Imaging FISH (CLASI-FISH) strategy using genus- and family-specific probes to visualize simultaneously and differentiate 15 different phylotypes in an artificial mixture of laboratory-grown microbes. We then illustrated the utility of our method for the structural analysis of a natural microbial community, namely, human dental plaque, a microbial biofilm. We demonstrate that 15 taxa in the plaque community can be imaged simultaneously and analyzed and that this community was dominated by early colonizers, including species of Streptococcus, Prevotella, Actinomyces, and Veillonella. Proximity analysis was used to determine the frequency of inter- and intrataxon cell-to-cell associations which revealed statistically significant intertaxon pairings. Cells of the genera Prevotella and Actinomyces showed the most interspecies associations, suggesting a central role for these genera in establishing and maintaining biofilm complexity. The results provide an initial systems-level structural analysis of biofilm organization.},

	Abstract = { <title>Author Summary</title> <p>Soil harbors a diverse spectrum of bacteria that secrete small molecules such as antibiotics. <italic>Streptomyces</italic> bacteria, considered the most prolific producers, have been mined for decades for novel products with therapeutic applications, yet little is known about the properties of the interaction networks these compounds mediate. These networks can hold clues about how the diversity of small molecules and of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> strains with different production and resistance capabilities is maintained and promoted. To explore the network properties, we developed a high-throughput platform for measuring pairwise phenotypic interactions mediated by secreted metabolites, and used it to measure the interaction network among 64 random <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates from several grains of soil. We found many strong but specific interactions that are on average determined more by metabolite production than by metabolite sensitivity. We found reciprocity between strains, whereby if one strain inhibits or promotes the growth of a second strain, it's likely that the second strain affects the first strain in a similar manner. These interactions are not correlated with phylogeny, as very closely related strains exhibit different interaction patterns. We could explain these findings with a mathematical model requiring interplay between ecological dynamics and evolution of antibiotic production and resistance, suggesting that the bacterial and small molecule diversity of these communities is maintained by constant evolutionary turnover of interaction phenotypes.</p> },

Modern microbiologists are learning “system thinking” and “holism.” Such an approach is changing our understanding of microbial physiology and our ability to diagnose/treat microbial infections. This review uses oral microbial communities as a focal point to describe this new trend. With the common name “dental plaque,” oral microbial communities are some of the most complex microbial floras in the human body, consisting of more than 700 different bacterial species. For a very long time, oral microbiologists endeavored to use reductionism to identify the key genes or key pathogens responsible for oral microbial pathogenesis. The limitations of reductionism forced scientists to begin adopting new strategies using emerging concepts such as interspecies interaction, microbial community, biofilms, polymicrobial disease, etc. These new research directions indicate that the whole is much more than the simple sum of its parts, since the interactions between different parts resulted in many new physiological functions which cannot be observed with individual components. This review describes some of these interesting interspecies-interaction scenarios.},

* Looks from abstract like analysis might be naive
* Focus on bacterial-virus-protist relationships in ocean},
	Annote1 = {Characterizing ecological relationships between viruses, bacteria and protists in the ocean are critical to understanding ecosystem function, yet these relationships are infrequently investigated together. We evaluated these relationships through microbial association network analysis of samples collected approximately monthly from March 2008 to January 2011 in the surface ocean (0-5{$[$}thinsp{$]$}m) at the San Pedro Ocean Time series station. Bacterial, T4-like myoviral and protistan communities were described by Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of the gene encoding the major capsid protein (g23) and 18S ribosomal DNA, respectively. Concurrent shifts in community structure suggested similar timing of responses to environmental and biological parameters. We linked T4-like myoviral, bacterial and protistan operational taxonomic units by local similarity correlations, which were then visualized as association networks. Network links (correlations) potentially represent synergistic and antagonistic relationships such as viral lysis, grazing, competition or other interactions. We found that virus-bacteria relationships were more cross-linked than protist-bacteria relationships, suggestive of increased taxonomic specificity in virus-bacteria relationships. We also found that 80{\%} of bacterial-protist and 74{\%} of bacterial-viral correlations were positive, with the latter suggesting that at monthly and seasonal timescales, viruses may be following their hosts more often than controlling host abundance.},

@article{GelmanAndRubin1992,
	Annote = {The Gibbs sampler, the algorithm of Metropolis and similar iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

Though existing microbial community profiling methods have attempted to rapidly classify the millions of reads output from modern sequencers, the combination of incomplete databases, similarity among otherwise divergent genomes, errors and biases in sequencing technologies, and the large volumes of sequencing data required for metagenome sequencing has led to unacceptably high false discovery rates (FDR). Here, we present the application of a novel, gene-independent and signature-based metagenomic taxonomic profiling method with significantly and consistently smaller FDR than any other available method. Our algorithm circumvents false positives using a series of non-redundant signature databases and examines Genomic Origins Through Taxonomic CHAllenge (GOTTCHA). GOTTCHA was tested and validated on 20 synthetic and mock datasets ranging in community composition and complexity, was applied successfully to data generated from spiked environmental and clinical samples, and robustly demonstrates superior performance compared with other available tools.},

	Url = {http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/7/1067.abstract N2 - Motivation: Identifying disease associated taxa and constructing networks for bacteria interactions are two important tasks usually studied separately. In reality, differentiation of disease associated taxa and correlation among taxa may affect each other. One genus can be differentiated because it is highly correlated with another highly differentiated one. In addition, network structures may vary under different clinical conditions. Permutation tests are commonly used to detect differences between networks in distinct phenotypes, and they are time-consuming.Results: In this manuscript, we propose a multilevel regularized regression method to simultaneously identify taxa and construct networks. We also extend the framework to allow construction of a common network and differentiated network together. An efficient algorithm with dual formulation is developed to deal with the large-scale n ≪ m problem with a large number of taxa (m) and a small number of samples (n) efficiently. The proposed method is regularized with a general Lp (p∈[0,2]) penalty and models the effects of taxa abundance differentiation and correlation jointly. We demonstrate that it can identify both true and biologically significant genera and network structures.Availability and implementation: Software MLRR in MATLAB is available at http://biostatistics.csmc.edu/mlrr/.Contact: liuzx@cshs.orgSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The large amount of data generated produces an opportunity to detect species even at very low levels, provided that computational tools can effectively profile the relevant metagenomic communities. Data interpretation is complicated by the fact that short sequencing reads can match multiple organisms and by the lack of completeness of existing databases, in particular for viral pathogens. Here we present metaMix, a Bayesian mixture model framework for resolving complex metagenomic mixtures. We show that the use of parallel Monte Carlo Markov chains for the exploration of the species space enables the identification of the set of species most likely to contribute to the mixture.Results: We demonstrate the greater accuracy of metaMix compared with relevant methods, particularly for profiling complex communities consisting of several related species. We designed metaMix specifically for the analysis of deep transcriptome sequencing datasets, with a focus on viral pathogen detection; however, the principles are generally applicable to all types of metagenomic mixtures.Availability and implementation: metaMix is implemented as a user friendly R package, freely available on CRAN: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metaMixContact: sofia.morfopoulou.10@ucl.ac.ukSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bionformatics online.},

	Annote = {We propose prior probability models for variance-covariance matrices in order to address two important issues. First, the models allow a researcher to represent substantive prior information about the strength of correlations among a set of variables. Secondly, even in the absence of such information, the increased flexibility of the models mitigates dependence on strict parametric assumptions in standard prior models. For example, the model allows a posteriori different levels of uncertainty about correlations among different subsets of variables. We achieve this by including a clustering mechanism in the prior probability model. Clustering is with respect to variables and pairs of variables. Our approach leads to shrinkage towards a mixture structure implied by the clustering. We discuss appropriate posterior simulation schemes to implement posterior inference in the proposed models, including the evaluation of normalising constants that are functions of parameters of interest. The normalising constants result from the restriction that the correlation matrix be positive definite. We discuss examples based on simulated data, a stock return dataset and a population genetics dataset.},

	Annote = {The problem of testing a point null hypothesis (or a "small interval" null hypothesis) is considered. Of interest is the relationship between the P value (or observed significance level) and conditional and Bayesian measures of evidence against the null hypothesis. Although one might presume that a small P value indicates the presence of strong evidence against the null, such is not necessarily the case. Expanding on earlier work {$[$}especially Edwards, Lindman, and Savage (1963) and Dickey (1977){$]$}, it is shown that actual evidence against a null (as measured, say, by posterior probability or comparative likelihood) can differ by an order of magnitude from the P value. For instance, data that yield a P value of .05, when testing a normal mean, result in a posterior probability of the null of at least .30 for any objective prior distribution. ("Objective" here means that equal prior weight is given the two hypotheses and that the prior is symmetric and nonincreasing away from the null; other definitions of "objective" will be seen to yield qualitatively similar results.) The overall conclusion is that P values can be highly misleading measures of the evidence provided by the data against the null hypothesis.},

@article{Meng1994,
	Annote = {Extending work of Rubin, this paper explores a Bayesian counterpart of the classical p-value, namely, a tail-area probability of a "test statistic" under a null hypothesis. The Bayesian formulation, using posterior predictive replications of the data, allows a "test statistic" to depend on both data and unknown (nuisance) parameters and thus permits a direct measure of the discrepancy between sample and population quantities. The tail-area probability for a "test statistic" is then found under the joint posterior distribution of replicate data and the (nuisance) parameters, both conditional on the null hypothesis. This posterior predictive p-value can also be viewed as the posterior mean of a classical p-value, averaging over the posterior distribution of (nuisance) parameters under the null hypothesis, and thus it provides one general method for dealing with nuisance parameters. Two classical examples, including the Behrens-Fisher problem, are used to illustrate the posterior predictive p-value and some of its interesting properties, which also reveal a new (Bayesian) interpretation for some classical p-values. An application to multiple-imputation inference is also presented. A frequency evaluation shows that, in general, if the replication is defined by new (nuisance) parameters and new data, then the Type I frequentist error of an α-level posterior predictive test is often close to but less than αand will never exceed 2α.},

	Abstract = {Ruminants rely on a complex rumen microbial community to convert dietary plant material to energy-yielding products. Here we developed a method to simultaneously analyze the community's bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes, ciliate 18S rRNA genes and anaerobic fungal internal transcribed spacer 1 genes using 12 DNA samples derived from 11 different rumen samples from three host species (\emph{Ovis aries}, \emph{Bos taurus}, \emph{Cervus elephas}) and multiplex 454 Titanium pyrosequencing. We show that the mixing ratio of the group-specific DNA templates before emulsion PCR is crucial to compensate for differences in amplicon length. This method, in contrast to using a non-specific universal primer pair, avoids sequencing non-targeted DNA, such as plant- or endophyte-derived rRNA genes, and allows increased or decreased levels of community structure resolution for each microbial group as needed. Communities analyzed with different primers always grouped by sample origin rather than by the primers used. However, primer choice had a greater impact on apparent archaeal community structure than on bacterial community structure, and biases for certain methanogen groups were detected. Co-occurrence analysis of microbial taxa from all three domains of life suggested strong within- and between-domain correlations between different groups of microorganisms within the rumen. The approach used to simultaneously characterize bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic components of a microbiota should be applicable to other communities occupying diverse habitats.},

It is hoped that this will yield novel insight into the role of these complex microbial communities in human health and disease. What is less appreciated is that this recent activity owes a great deal to the pioneering efforts of microbial ecologists who have been studying communities in non-host-associated environments. Interactions between environmental microbiologists and human microbiota researchers have already contributed to advances in our understanding of the human microbiome. We review the work that has led to these recent advances and illustrate some of the possible future directions for continued collaboration between these groups of researchers. We discuss how the application of ecological theory to the human-associated microbiota can lead us past descriptions of community structure and toward an understanding of the functions of the human microbiota. Such an approach may lead to a shift in the prevention and treatment of human diseases that involves conservation or restoration of the normal community structure and function of the host-associated microbiota.},

	Abstract = {Advances in DNA sequencing have allowed us to characterize microbial communities---including those associated with the human body---at a broader range of spatial and temporal scales than ever before. We can now answer fundamental questions that were previously inaccessible and use well‐tested ecological theories to gain insight into changes in the microbiome that are associated with normal development and human disease. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the ecosystems associated with our body follow trends identified in communities at other sites and scales, and thus studies of the microbiome benefit from ecological insight. Here, we assess human microbiome research in the context of ecological principles and models, focusing on diversity, biological drivers of community structure, spatial patterning and temporal dynamics, and suggest key directions for future research that will bring us closer to the goal of building predictive models for personalized medicine.},

	Abstract = {We examine co-occurrence patterns of microorganisms to evaluate community assembly ?rules.? We use methods previously applied to macroorganisms, both to evaluate their applicability to microorganisms and to allow comparison of co-occurrence patterns observed in microorganisms to those found in macroorganisms. We use a null model analysis of 124 incidence matrices from microbial communities, including bacteria, archaea, fungi, and algae, and we compare these results to previously published findings from a meta-analysis of almost 100 macroorganism data sets. We show that assemblages of microorganisms demonstrate nonrandom patterns of co-occurrence that are broadly similar to those found in assemblages of macroorganisms. These results suggest that some taxon co-occurrence patterns may be general characteristics of communities of organisms from all domains of life. We also find that co-occurrence in microbial communities does not vary among taxonomic groups or habitat types. However, we find that the degree of co-occurrence does vary among studies that use different methods to survey microbial communities. Finally, we discuss the potential effects of the undersampling of microbial communities on our results, as well as processes that may contribute to nonrandom patterns of co-occurrence in both macrobial and microbial communities such as competition, habitat filtering, historical effects, and neutral processes.},

Nice intro on what has been done in studying microbial communities, and how networks are less common
Some additional examples of network analysis applied to microbial ecology
Sought to address three questions:
(1) "Do soil micro-organisms co-occur more often than would be expected by chance?"
(2) "Can the lack of agreement between observed and random intra-phyla co-occurrence be used as a proxy of niche differentiation?"
(3) "Which taxa are generalists (broadly distributed across soil habitats) or specialists (restricted to certain habitats but locally abundant) and how these ecological categories shape network structure?"
Used the C-score to see if cooccurrence patterns were non-random
Used some topological properties--Newman 2003
"The magnitude of the lack of agreement between the observed intra-phyla percentage of significant co-occurrences, on the one hand, and the expected assembling under random association, on the other hand, may be used as an index of niche preferences or synergetic relationships."
Co-occurrence patterns can be driven by overlapping niches or by symbiosis, but correlations cannot distinguish between the two.
Abundance vs. occupancy plot (plotting read counts vs. number of occupied sites) was used to distinguish generalists (high occupancy) and specialists (high abundance and low occupancy).

* Krause et al 2003 looked at species in a food web
* Previous examples of network analysis of microbial interactions:
  * Ruan Q, Dutta D, Schwalbach MS, Steele JA, Fuhrman JA, Sun F. (2006). Local similarity analysis reveals unique associations among marine bacterioplankton species and environmental factors. Bioinformatics 22: 2532.
  * Chaffron S, Rehrauer H, Pernthaler J, von Mering C. (2010). A global network of coexisting microbes from environmental and whole-genome sequence data. Genome Res 20: 947--959.

* Co-occur more often than chance?
* Lack of agreement between obs. and random intra-taxon co-occurrence useful to identify niche differentiation?
* Generalist vs. specialist taxa?
* Used checkerboard and Spearman correlation to evaluate the co-occurrence patterns?
* Calculated average node connectivity, average path length, diameter, cumulative degree distribution, clustering coefficient and modularity (Newman MEJ. (2003). The structure and function of complex networks. SIAM Rev 45: 167--256.)
* Also look up Prosser JI, Bohannan BJ, Curtis TP, Ellis RJ, Firestone MK, Freckleton RP et al. (2007). The role of ecological theory in microbial ecology. Nat Rev Microbiol 5: 384--392.
* Also look up Horner-Devine MC, Silver JM, Leibold MA, Bohannan BJ, Colwell RK, Fuhrman JA et al. (2007). A comparison of taxon co-occurrence patterns for macro- and micro- organisms. Ecology 88: 1345--1353.
* I'm confused; they use the C-score to say 'there's more co-occurrence than random', but the C-score measures co-exclusion; what's going on here?
* Cite Newman 2003 for common topological properties they calculated

* This paper looks at the network of microbes in soil using the C-score and Spearman correlation
  * Find that soil microorganisms 'occur more than expected by chance'
  * Find that the network 'was comprised of highly connected OTUs structured among densely connected groups of nodes and forming a clustered topology'
   * OTUs from the same phyla tend to occur more than expected (hypothesize this is because they share similar niches, rather than because they are symbiotic)
  * Did not observe positive correlation between abundance and occupancy
* Figures:
  * 1 = overall network (a=colored by taxonomy, b=colored by generalist/specialist)
  * 2 = abundance vs. occupancy scatter plot to define specialists and generalists
  * 3 = network of co-occurring generalists and specialists (I think just a subnetwork of 1b)
  * 4 = Relative abundance of phyla with reference to different totals (top=% sequences from phylum; middle=% nodes in significant network?; bottom=% of generalist nodes)
* Network statistics:
  * Number of nodes and edges
  * Average degree
  * Cumulative degree distribution
  * Average path length
  * Longest path length
  * Clustering coefficient
  * Modularity index},

Short section on cooccurrence networks
* Interpreting ecological relevance is hard--a positive relationship could be a result of several distinct ecological scenarios
* Pairwise relationships cannot capture more complex forms of ecological interactions (e.g., "one species depends on (or is influenced by) multiple other species")
** In this case, can use regression or rule mining
An interesting box on the role of ecological interactions versus random processes in community assembly
* Hubbell's "neutral theory" - Rosindell J., Hubbell, S. P. & Etienne, R.S.  The unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography at age ten.  Trends Ecol. Evol.  26, 340-348 (2011).
* Some studies applying the different theories to microbial data.
The dependencies from networks can be used to build dynamic models ("a set of differential or difference equations or Boolean functions")
An alternative cooccurrence network inference methodology is local similarity analysis (LSA)
Association networks can be used to identify members of alternative communities
Section on some of the difficulties of network analysis in microbial data - compositionality and sparsity

One has to be careful with interpreting network analysis--"hub species" might not be keystone species (it depends on the type of interactions they possess)
Co-culturing is a useful way to study species interactions, but it needs to scale up both because many species cannot be cultured as yet and because typically few species are cultured at a time.
Co-occurrence networks offer only a static picture of the microbiome; dynamic modeling allows us to see how the community shifts and adapts in response to challenges

A review on computational models for the microbiome
* Topology-based versus constraint-based community level metabolism models
** Topology-based look at a network of metabolic processes 
** Constraint-based define the total set of constraints in a given species
* Reverse ecology "aims to identify such universal structural signatures that can then be used to obtain insights into the ecology of poorly characterized species."
* Briefly mentions cooccurrence networks
* Some work has been done to combine species-specific networks into community-level structures.
** "A standard framework for constructing and analyzing stoichiometric ecosystem models is still lacking and several conceptual challenges should be addressed before such a modeling framework can be introduced"
*** Thinking about which assumptions of the model might hold or be altered in a community setting.
* The microbiome can also be modeled as a single supra-organism
** Implicitly taken by the functional capacity approach
** Few studies are so far available.
* Two things we could do with predictive models if we had them
** Design and direct bacteriotherapy (modulation of microbiome via antibiotics, probiotics or transplantation)
** "characterize the contours of the space of possible ecosystem configurations"

***NOTES***
Possible views of the relationship of host and microbiome:
(1) host as "habitat filter", where host shapes microbiome but not vice versa
(2) a community of interacting cells, where host and microbiome shape each other
(3) "holobiont"--"an ecological system under selection to minimize conflict between individual members"

"Community assembly can be conceptualized as being niche-based, dispersal-limited, historically contingent, or random, depending on the relative contributions of habitat conditions, colonist availability, arrival order (and timing), or chance-driven events, respectively, in shaping observed patterns."

"Metacommunity theory views the world as a collection of patches--spatially distance areas of suitable habitat surrounded by a matrix of unsuitable habitat.  These patches each contain a community of organisms, and these spatially distinct communities are connected together to form a metacommunity by the dispersal of organisms from patch to patch."

Qin et al 2010 - bacterial genes outnumber human genes

"We know that the human microbiome can alter host susceptibility to microbial pathogens, aid in the digestion of complex polysaccharides, produce metabolites required by the host (eg., vitamins or specific amino acids), modulate and educate the immune system, regulate environmental conditions within body habitats, and influence tissue development (Gill et al 2006, Pflughoeft and Versalovic 2011, Robinson et al 2010)"

"A wide range of diseases that have been linked to dysbioses[{\ldots} including] bacterial  vaginosis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, gingivitis, obesity, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome (Frank et al 2011, Pflughoeft & Versalovic 2011)"

Bugs can act differently in community than alone
* Strep example (Jenkinson 2011)

"These [methodological] advances enable us to move research on the human microbiome into the realm of ecology, describing and predicting the inter- and intraindividual variability in microbial communities and their functional capabilities"

Differences between microbial ecology and macro ecology
* macro ecology surveys rely on visual observations; microbial ecology relies on sequencing data
* microbiologists lack knowledge about the "natural histories of most microbial taxa, even those taxa commonly found in the human body"
* Since bugs are smaller and reproduce more rapidly than multicellular organisms, there are unique spatial and temporal issues to consider

"Alpha diversity is generally defined as richness (the number of taxa or lineages in a given sample), evenness (the relative abundance of taxa present within a given sample), or a metric that combines these two parameters (e.g., Shannon-Weiner diversity index)."
* Faith & Baker 2006 - alpha diversity patterns using metrics that incorporate phylogenetic information
* Petchey & Gaston 2007 - " " " " " " " functional or trait-based information

"alpha diversity levels can vary dramatically between individuals, across body habitats, and within an individual body habitat over time (Caporaso et al 2011, Costello et al 2009)"

Processes that can generate the alpha diversity patterns observed:
* environmental gradients, disturbance regimes, resource competition, predator-prey interactions and niche differentiation (Ricklefs & Schluter 1993, Rosenzweig 1995)
* neutral processes (Hubbel 2001)

Diversity is associated with some disease, but direction is not necessarily consistent and the causation is unclear--though alpha diversity can still be used as an general indicator of health status.

"beta diversity [is] defined as the taxonomic or phylogenetic difference in community composition between samples"
* Anderson et al 2011, Gharam & Fine 2008 for an overview of various metrics

Niche or neutral processes can generate the obs. differences in beta diversity

Some evidence exists for niche processes, but there are limitations
* Measuring the appropriate ecological parameters
* Characterizing niches for organisms that are so small is complex, esp. considering, eg., the diversity of microscopic environments in the human gut

Neutral processes assume that the obs. diversity is a result of stochastic events
Neutral processes have the advantage of being simple to fit, but again they can be hard to quantify
* Eg, size/composition of "metacommunity" or dispersal rates within it

Both niche and neutral processes are probably involved and important in shaping the human microbiome; it is important to understand in which conditions each are most important

"The intestinal community of an infant can switch from an Actinobacteria- and Proteobacteria-dominated community to an adult like state dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes upon the introduction of plant-derived foods like peas (Koenig et al. 2011)"

"Some microbial communities undergo succession in concert with the developmental stages of the host"

"though there are variations in microbial community composition over time, each body habitat appears to exist in its own stability domain"

"Response of microbial communities to perturbations can be characterized by their resistance, resilience, and whether their stable states are changed (Allison & Martiny 2008)"

Competition for limited resources is likely a driver of community structure of the microbiome, but niche specialization can allow microbes to co-exist even when the resource requirements overlap.

Interactions between microbes and host can prevent other microbes from colonizing and/or growing

Predator-prey relationships could exist both between viruses and bacteria or between bacteria and bacteria.

The difficulties in building interaction networks are that there are many potential interactions, the interactions are not necessarily linear (eg., quorum sensing) and that functional information is necessary to also understand precisely why two species might co-occur.

Standard statistical techniques for the analysis of such data assume the absence of proportions which are genuinely zero. However, real data can contain a substantial number of zero values. We present a latent Gaussian model for the analysis of compositional data which contain zero values, which is based on assuming that the data arise from a (deterministic) Euclidean projection of a multivariate Gaussian random variable onto the unit simplex. We propose an iterative algorithm to simulate values from this model and apply the model to data on the proportions of fat, protein and carbohydrate in different groups of food products. Finally, evaluation of the likelihood involves the calculation of difficult integrals if the number of components is more than 3, so we present a hybrid Gibbs rejection sampling scheme that can be used to draw inferences about the parameters of the model when the number of components is arbitrarily large.},

Widely used methods of determining preference from measurements of usage and availability depend critically on the array of components that the researcher, often with a degree of arbitrariness, deems available to the animal. This paper proposes a new method, based on ranks of components by usage and by availability. A virtue of the rank procedure is that it provides comparable results whether a questionable component is included or excluded from consideration. Statistical tests of significance are given for the method. The paper also offers a hierarchical ordering of selection processes.

It is argued that the statistical analysis of such data has proved difficult because of a lack both of concepts of independence and of rich enough parametric classes of distributions in the simplex.  A variety of independence hypotheses are introduced and interrelated, and new classes of transformed-normal distributions in the simplex are provided as models within which the independence hypotheses can be tested through standard theory of parametric hypothesis testing.

	Abstract = {The Dirichlet class of distributions on the simplex is overstructured for practical work because of its many strong independence properties.  A persistent problem of distribution theory has thus been to extend this class to include members free of these independence properties.  An alternative approach has been the recent introduction of the logsitic-normal class which contains members with and without the independence properties.  Unfortunately, this class is separate from the Dirichlet class and so cannot sustain discussion of some strong forms of independence.  These difficulties are overcome in this paper by the introduction of a more general class which includes as special cases the Dirichlet and logistic-normal classes.  The role of this new class in relation to the analysis of compositional data, in particular the investication of independence hypotheses, is discussed and illustrated.},

A simple procedure was given there as an FDR controlling procedure for independent test statistics and was shown to be much more powerful than comparable procedures which control the traditional family wise error rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses.This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate t. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the procedure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased.},

The algebra aids interpretation of treatment effects, treatment interactions, and covariates. MarkovchainMonteCarlo (MCMC) is used for inference in a Bayesian framework.

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: The human microbiome plays an important role in human disease and health. Identification of factors that affect the microbiome composition can provide insights into disease mechanism as well as suggest ways to modulate the microbiome composition for therapeutical purposes. Distance-based statistical tests have been applied to test the association of microbiome composition with environmental or biological covariates. The unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances are the most widely used distance measures. However, these two measures assign too much weight either to rare lineages or to most abundant lineages, which can lead to loss of power when the important composition change occurs in moderately abundant lineages. RESULTS: We develop generalized UniFrac distances that extend the weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances for detecting a much wider range of biologically relevant changes. We evaluate the use of generalized UniFrac distances in associating microbiome composition with environmental covariates using extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that tests using the unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances are less powerful in detecting abundance change in moderately abundant lineages. In contrast, the generalized UniFrac distance is most powerful in detecting such changes, yet it retains nearly all its power for detecting rare and highly abundant lineages. The generalized UniFrac distance also has an overall better power than the joint use of unweighted/weighted UniFrac distances. Application to two real microbiome datasets has demonstrated gains in power in testing the associations between human microbiome and diet intakes and habitual smoking.

	Abstract = {With the development of next generation sequencing technology, researchers have now been able to study the microbiome composition using direct sequencing, whose output are bacterial taxa counts for each microbiome sample. One goal of microbiome study is to associate the microbiome composition with environmental covariates. We propose to model the taxa counts using a Dirichlet-multinomial (DM) regression model in order to account for overdispersion of observed counts. The DM regression model can be used for testing the association between taxa composition and covariates using the likelihood ratio test. However, when the number of the covariates is large, multiple testing can lead to loss of power. To deal with the high dimensionality of the problem, we develop a penalized likelihood approach to estimate the regression parameters and to select the variables by imposing a sparse group [Formula: see text] penalty to encourage both group-level and within-group sparsity. Such a variable selection procedure can lead to selection of the relevant covariates and their associated bacterial taxa. An efficient block-coordinate descent algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem. We present extensive simulations to demonstrate that the sparse DM regression can result in better identification of the microbiome-associated covariates than models that ignore overdispersion or only consider the proportions. We demonstrate the power of our method in an analysis of a data set evaluating the effects of nutrient intake on human gut microbiome composition. Our results have clearly shown that the nutrient intake is strongly associated with the human gut microbiome.},

	Abstract = {The healthy microbiota show remarkable variability within and among individuals. In addition to external exposures, ecological relationships (both oppositional and symbiotic) between microbial inhabitants are important contributors to this variation. It is thus of interest to assess what relationships might exist among microbes and determine their underlying reasons. The initial Human Microbiome Project (HMP) cohort, comprising 239 individuals and 18 different microbial habitats, provides an unprecedented resource to detect, catalog, and analyze such relationships. Here, we applied an ensemble method based on multiple similarity measures in combination with generalized boosted linear models (GBLMs) to taxonomic marker (16S rRNA gene) profiles of this cohort, resulting in a global network of 3,005 significant co-occurrence and co-exclusion relationships between 197 clades occurring throughout the human microbiome. This network revealed strong niche specialization, with most microbial associations occurring within body sites and a number of accompanying inter-body site relationships. Microbial communities within the oropharynx grouped into three distinct habitats, which themselves showed no direct influence on the composition of the gut microbiota. Conversely, niches such as the vagina demonstrated little to no decomposition into region-specific interactions. Diverse mechanisms underlay individual interactions, with some such as the co-exclusion of Porphyromonaceae family members and Streptococcus in the subgingival plaque supported by known biochemical dependencies. These differences varied among broad phylogenetic groups as well, with the Bacilli and Fusobacteria, for example, both enriched for exclusion of taxa from other clades. Comparing phylogenetic versus functional similarities among bacteria, we show that dominant commensal taxa (such as Prevotellaceae and Bacteroides in the gut) often compete, while potential pathogens (e.g. Treponema and Prevotella in the dental plaque) are more likely to co-occur in complementary niches. This approach thus serves to open new opportunities for future targeted mechanistic studies of the microbial ecology of the human microbiome.},

	Abstract = {High-throughput sequencing based techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene profiling, have the potential to elucidate the complex inner workings of natural microbial communities - be they from the world's oceans or the human gut. A key step in exploring such data is the identification of dependencies between members of these communities, which is commonly achieved by correlation analysis. However, it has been known since the days of Karl Pearson that the analysis of the type of data generated by such techniques (referred to as compositional data) can produce unreliable results since the observed data take the form of relative fractions of genes or species, rather than their absolute abundances. Using simulated and real data from the Human Microbiome Project, we show that such compositional effects can be widespread and severe: in some real data sets many of the correlations among taxa can be artifactual, and true correlations may even appear with opposite sign. Additionally, we show that community diversity is the key factor that modulates the acuteness of such compositional effects, and develop a new approach, called SparCC (available at https://bitbucket.org/yonatanf/sparcc), which is capable of estimating correlation values from compositional data. To illustrate a potential application of SparCC, we infer a rich ecological network connecting hundreds of interacting species across 18 sites on the human body. Using the SparCC network as a reference, we estimated that the standard approach yields 3 spurious species-species interactions for each true interaction and misses 60\% of the true interactions in the human microbiome data, and, as predicted, most of the erroneous links are found in the samples with the lowest diversity.},

@article{HeinAndMcKinley2013,
	Abstract = {Most motile organisms use sensory cues when searching for resources, mates, or prey. The searcher measures sensory data and adjusts its search behavior based on those data. Yet, classical models of species encounter rates assume that searchers move independently of their targets. This assumption leads to the familiar mass action-like encounter rate kinetics typically used in modeling species interactions. Here we show that this common approach can mischaracterize encounter rate kinetics if searchers use sensory information to search actively for targets. We use the example of predator-prey interactions to illustrate that predators capable of long-distance directional sensing can encounter prey at a rate proportional to prey density to the [Formula: see text] power (where [Formula: see text] is the dimension of the environment) when prey density is low. Similar anomalous encounter rate functions emerge even when predators pursue prey using only noisy, directionless signals. Thus, in both the high-information extreme of long-distance directional sensing, and the low-information extreme of noisy non-directional sensing, encounter rate kinetics differ qualitatively from those derived by classic theory of species interactions. Using a standard model of predator-prey population dynamics, we show that the new encounter rate kinetics derived here can change the outcome of species interactions. Our results demonstrate how the use of sensory information can alter the rates and outcomes of physical interactions in biological systems.},

The support of the logistic normal includes all distributions that are absolutely continuous with respect to the dominating measure of the observations.  The logistic-normal family is closed in the prior to posterior Bayes analysis, with the observations entering the posterior distribution through the covariance function of the Gaussian process.  The covariance of the Gaussian process plays the role of a smoothing kernel.  Three features of the model provide a flexible structure for computing the predictive density: (a) The mean of the Gaussian process corresponds to the prior mean of the random density. (b) The prior variance of the Gaussian process controls the influence of the data in the posterior process. As variance increases, the predictive density has greater fidelity to the data.  (c) The prior covariance of the Gaussian process controls the smoothness of its sample paths and the amount of pooling of the sample information.  For iid observations the empirical distribution function (edf) is a sufficient statistic for all inference.  Since the human eye finds it difficult to distinguish important features of distribution functions, their densities often are plotted instead.  Unfortunately, the edf does not possess a density function with respect to Lebesgue measure; consequently, many techniques have been proposed to smooth the edf so that its modification does possess a proper density.  From the subjective, Bayesian perspective, the data are iid given a common but unspecified density.  Beliefs about the unknown density are modeled through probability statements.  When the density has a known functional form, the prior distribution concerns the density's parameters, which describe important, unknown features of the density.  In this article the density is not constrained to a functional form, so it becomes the parameter of interest.  Its posterior distribution becomes the mechanism for smoothing the edt so that the density estimator (the posterior mean) evaluated at a point can use nearby data. },

	Abstract = {This paper describes a Bayesian procedure for the simultaneous estimation of the probabilities in a histogram.  A two-stage prior distribution is constructed which assumes that probabilities corresponding to adjacent intervals are likely to be closely related.  The method employs multivariate logit transformations, and a covariance structure similar to that assumed in the first-order autoregressive process.  Posterior estimates are obtained which combine information between the intervals and have the practical effect of smoothing the histogram.},

@article{ManorAndSegal2013,
	Abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely used to search for genetic loci that underlie human disease. Another goal is to predict disease risk for different individuals given their genetic sequence. Such predictions could either be used as a "black box" in order to promote changes in life-style and screening for early diagnosis, or as a model that can be studied to better understand the mechanism of the disease. Current methods for risk prediction typically rank single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by the p-value of their association with the disease, and use the top-associated SNPs as input to a classification algorithm. However, the predictive power of such methods is relatively poor. To improve the predictive power, we devised BootRank, which uses bootstrapping in order to obtain a robust prioritization of SNPs for use in predictive models. We show that BootRank improves the ability to predict disease risk of unseen individuals in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) data and results in a more robust set of SNPs and a larger number of enriched pathways being associated with the different diseases. Finally, we show that combining BootRank with seven different classification algorithms improves performance compared to previous studies that used the WTCCC data. Notably, diseases for which BootRank results in the largest improvements were recently shown to have more heritability than previously thought, likely due to contributions from variants with low minimum allele frequency (MAF), suggesting that BootRank can be beneficial in cases where SNPs affecting the disease are poorly tagged or have low MAF. Overall, our results show that improving disease risk prediction from genotypic information may be a tangible goal, with potential implications for personalized disease screening and treatment.},

	Abstract = {In this paper limit theorems for the conditional distributions of linear test statistics are proved. The
assertions are conditioned on the σ-field of permutation symmetric sets. Limit theorems are proved both for the conditional distributions under the hypothesis of randomness and under general contiguous alternatives with independent but not identically distributed observations. The proofs are based on results on limit theorems for exchangeable random variables by Strasser and Weber, [20]. The limit theorems under contiguous alternatives are consequences of a LAN-result for likelihood ratios of symmetrized product measures. The results of the paper have implications for statistical applications. By example it is shown that minimum variance partitions which are defined by observed data (e.g. by LVQ) lead to asymptotically optimal adaptive tests for the k-sample problem. As another application it is shown that
conditional k-sample tests which are based on data-driven partitions lead to simple confidence sets which can be used for the simultaneous analysis of linear constrasts.},

@article{UlrichAndGotelli2010,
	Abstract = {The influence of negative species interactions has dominated much of the
literature on community assembly rules. Patterns of negative covariation among species are
typically documented through null model analyses of binary presence/absence matrices in which rows designate species, columns designate sites, and the matrix entries indicate the
presence (1) or absence (0) of a particular species ina particular site. However, the outcome of
species interactions ultimately depends on population-level processes. Therefore, patterns of
species segregation and aggregation might be more clearly expressed in abundance matrices, in which the matrix entries indicate the abundance or density of a species in a particular site.

We conducted a series of benchmark tests to evaluate the performanceof 14 candidate null model algorithms and six covariation metrics that can be used with abundance matrices. We
first created a series of random test matrices by sampling a metacommunity from a lognormal species abundance distribution. We also created a series of structured matrices by altering the
random matrices to incorporate patterns of pairwise species segregationand aggregation.We next screened each algorithm-index combination with the random and structured matrices to determinewhich tests had lowType I error rates and good power for detecting segregated and aggregated species distributions. In our benchmark tests, the best-performing null model does not constrain species richness, but assigns individuals to matrix cells proportional to the observed row and column marginal distributions until, for each row and column, total abundances are reached.

Using this null model algorithm with a set of four covariance metrics, we tested for patterns of species segregationand aggregation in a collection of 149 empirical abundance matrices and 36 interaction matrices collated from published papers and posted datasets. More than 80\% of
the matrices were significantly segregated, which reinforces a previous meta-analysis of presence/absence matrices. However, using two of the metrics we detected a significant pattern of aggregation for plants and for the interaction matrices (which include plant-pollinator data
sets).  These results suggest that abundance matrices, analyzed with an appropriate null model, may be a powerful tool for quantifying patterns of species segregation and aggregation.},

Measures of variability for three data types--replicate, locational, and compositional--are considered; the source and nature of the variability determine the appropriate type of measure. To illustrate the effects of these measures and expose their inadequacy when improperly applied, the variability of a three-column data set is interpreted under three different suppositions.
